Hi! My name is John Patrick Y. De Salit

I am currently a 4th year student studying BS in Computer Science in De La Salle University Dasmarinas. I'm finishing my OJT which we took on our 3rd year special term practicum which required us to render 240 hours on a company.

My hobbies are playing computer games, listening to music, and watching movies and tv series. I spent most of my time with my computer. I also love and enjoy coding even if I struggle to understand or debug a program. Video games that i usually play are MOBA games and strategy games. My favorite music artists includes The Weeknd, Joji, and Post Malone. My all time favorite tv shows were Game of Thrones, Breaking Bad, and Vikings.
